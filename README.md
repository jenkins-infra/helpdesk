# Help desk

Support for Infrastructure related issues for the Jenkins project.

If you want to report an issue or a bug with [one of the services run by the Jenkins project](https://www.jenkins.io/projects/infrastructure/), [**open an issue here**](https://github.com/jenkins-infra/helpdesk/issues/new/choose)!

If your issue or bug concerns Jenkins itself, please open an issue here instead: https://issues.jenkins.io/projects/JENKINS

Status of hosted services and maintenance announcements can be seen on a dedicated status page https://status.jenkins.io. You can stay updated of incidents and maintenance by following [our RSS feed](https://status.jenkins.io/index.xml) at the bottom of the status page.
